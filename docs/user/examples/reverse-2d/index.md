## Overview

This suite of examples demonstrates use of a number of features for a vertical cross section of a reverse fault accompanied by a splay fault ({numref}`fig:example:reverse:2d:geometry`) with elastic and viscoelastic material properties.
We separately consider loading from gravitational body forces, surface tractions, and coseismic slip.
We build on the previous examples and add complexity through a series of steps:

:Step 1: Gravitational body forces and linear isotropic elasticity.
:Step 2: Gravitational body forces and linear isotropic elasticity with a reference stress state.
:Step 3: Gravitational body forces and linear isotropic incompressible elasticity.
:Step 4: Surface tractions and linear isotropic linear elasticity.
:Step 5: Earthquake rupture on one fault and linear isotropic linear elasticity.
:Step 6: Earthquake rupture on two faults and linear isotropic linear elasticity.
:Step 7: Earthquake rupture on two faults and linear isotropic Maxwell viscoelastic rheology.
:Step 8: Earthquake rupture on two faults and linear isotropic powerlaw viscoelastic rheology.

Diagram of geometry for domain with reverse and splay faults and three materials (crust, slab, and wedge).
The domain extends from -100 km to +100 km in the x direction and from -100 km to 0 in the y direction.
We refer to the domain boundaries using the names shown in the diagram.

:::{important}
We describe how to generate the finite-element mesh using both Gmsh and Cubit.
The mesh files for both methods are included; however, we only use the Gmsh file in the PyLith parameter files.
See [examples/strikeslip-2d/step01_slip_cubit.cfg](../strikeslip-2d/step01-slip.md) for a description of how to modify the parameter files to switch from using mesh files from Gmsh to mesh files from Cubit.
