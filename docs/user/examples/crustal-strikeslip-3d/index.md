# Intersecting Strike-Slip Faults (3D)

*New in v4.1.0.*

The files are in the directory `examples/crustal-strikeslip-3d`.
The files and directories for this set of examples includes:

:`README.md`: README file containing a brief description of the various examples.
:`*.cfg`: PyLith parameter files.
:`faulttrace*_latlon.txt`: Coordinates of points on fault traces in geographic coordinates.
:`faulttrace*_utm.txt`: Coordinates of points on fault traces in the UTM zone 11 projection.
:`generate_gmsh.py`: Python script to generate the finite-element mesh using Gmsh.
:`generate_cubit.py`: Python script to generate the finite-element mesh using Cubit.
:`*.msh`: Gmsh finite-element mesh files generated by Gmsh.
:`*.spatialdb`: Spatial database filesFiles associated with the spatial databases.
:`output`: Directory containing simulation output. It is created automatically when running the simulations.

## Overview

This suite of examples demonstrates using PyLith to model multiple intersecting faults embedded in a 3D georeferenced domain ({numref}`fig:example:crustal:strikeslip:3d:overview`).
The geometry is based on studies of the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence by {cite:t}`Uphoff:etal:2022` and {cite:t}`Nevitt:etal:2023`.

:Step 1: Static uniform coseismic slip with Dirichlet (displacement) boundary conditions.
:Step 2: Static spatially varying coseismic slip with Dirichlet (displacement) boundary conditions.

Diagram of geometry for the domain with three intersecting strike-slip faults.
The domain extends from 80 km in the east-west direction, 60 km in the north-south direction, and 40 km in the vertical direction.
We refer to the domain boundaries using the names shown in the diagram.

:::{important}
We describe how to generate the finite-element mesh using both Gmsh and Cubit.
For Step 1 we provide PyLith parameter files for both meshes; for Step 2 we only provide the parameter files that use the Gmsh file.
